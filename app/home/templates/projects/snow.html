<p class="projects_right">In the beginning, we originally planned to tell the history of the ice sports in the origin of the Winter Olympic movement section.
  <br /><br />
  However, as more and more information was compiled, I found that stuffing down the more in-depth history in the form of the Winter Olympic Games mini-games might seem ponderous, not easy reading.
  <br /><br />
  Therefore, I took out the history of the ice sports separately. The my colleagues and I worked together, expanded and produced "From the Caveman Movement to the Great Hall of Fame, What Make Ice Sports Popular Worldwide".
</p>

<p>During the process, Yanjun and I chewed a lot of papers, lamenting the unparalleled beauty of St. Moritz. She even jokingly said that her wedding ceremony should be held in St. Moritz in the future</p>
<p>I also communicated with Bichi on how to combine his drawings and content, my expression was not in point, which caused him to make more efforts to split the PS layers</p>
<p>I studied with Xiaoyin on how to superimpose the snow depth on the China map, our ideal is to make a relief-like snow depth map of China. However, the dream is very abundant, the reality is very skeletal......</p>

<p>But before the end of this project, I encountered a very torturous bug, which was actually very simple, but at that time, I was alone in my hometown. No one can help me. And I couldn't find the answer by Google. So in that case, I "shout a lot" to vent my anger. My mother thought I was under huge pressure at work and told me to quit and go home to rely on her, haha~</p>

<p>Want to see exactly how I was tortured, you can jump to here:</p>
