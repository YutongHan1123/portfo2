<p>The Beijing Winter Olympics opened on February 4, 2022. In October of the previous year, I proposed the idea of a long-term project for the Winter Olympics at the group meeting.
</p>

<p>And my leaders Meng Wei, Mingzhong Geng were very supportive.</p>
  
<p>Immediately thereafter, my colleague Yi Zhang, intern Yuxin Bai and I set up a Winter Olympics team.</p>

<p>This project took about 3 months from inception to launch. In the first month, we were in the exploration stage. Although there was a vague idea, we didn't have a clue about what content to do or what data we needed. During the second month, we decided on the general content and format. That means it took about two months to complete the project.</p>

<h1>The idea</h1>

<p>In the beginning, we originally planned to tell the history of the ice sports in the origin of the Winter Olympic movement section. However, as more and more information was compiled, I found that stuffing down the more in-depth history in the form of the Winter Olympic Games mini-games might seem ponderous, not easy reading. </p>

<p>Therefore, with the permission of my leaders, I took out the history of the ice tour separately and expanded the content with my buddies. Because the Winter Olympics mini-game focuses on interaction which is light reading. We thought about how we could make this piece involving the history of skiing and the current situation of China's mass skiing market more in-depth.</p>

<p>Before that, I was taught by my work in writing: If you don't understand something, read papers and research reports. As long as I nibble deep enough and enough content, I can quickly build up my understanding of a thing from nothing to something.</p>


<h1>The logics</h1>

<p>After chewing through a lot of papers with my buddies, we settled on a logic for the article: It starts with the original origins of skiing, then goes on to describe the different roles that skiing played in different eras, followed by how it evolved from an aristocratic sport to a popular industry after the industrial revolution. Then we move on to the current state of the Chinese snow and ice industry.</p>

<p class="img_sidenote">Outline of the current status of China's snow and ice industry</p>

<p>When it comes to the section on China's mass snow and ice industry, we would like to take a look at some of the early major ski resorts in China and talk about how things have changed in the past two decades. How many new ski resorts were added, how the epidemic hit them, what is the current domestic ice and snow sports industry chain, etc.</p>

<p>Notably, when we read papers and research papers, we found that there are now more and more indoor ski resorts in China, and they are getting increasingly larger. In addition, snowboarding is on the rise, gradually encroaching on double boarding.</p>

<p class="img_sidenote">Yanjun and I assigned the task and set up the due</p>


<p>In the section on the history of skiing, I benefited from Andrew Denning's <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43280379"><em>Alpine Modern: Central European Skiing and the Vernacularization of Cultural Modernism, 1900–1939</em></a>. In the article, the author mentions that "Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, a rapidly growing, socially elite group of hikers, mountain climbers, cure seekers, ice skaters, holiday-makers, Sommerfrischler, and spa patrons, all of whom drew inspiration from Romantic landscape aesthetics, sought to escape urban life in ‘the playground of Europe’", which is a proof of European skiing from the aristocracy to the masses.</p>

<p>Another article I enjoyed was "The Alps and the Imagination" by Fergus Fleming. The author mentions that before the 18th century, "the dangers of Alpine travel were intertwined with the prevailing imagination of the people. Superstition shrouded the peaks: witches danced on the ice; strange people from unknown lands lived above the snow line, and many dragons thrived on the high slopes, ready to reduce unsuspecting intruders to ashes. Rumor has it that the magic stone on the dragon's head can be used to cure bleeding, dysentery, diarrhea, plague, nosebleeds, and other diseases. People can enter the dragon's lair by lighting herbs while the dragon is sleeping and kill it to obtain this magic stone. But one must be careful with Jiji, if the dragon is killed while awake, the stone will have no divine effect. "</p>

<p>In addition to the two articles mentioned above, <a href="https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/gtr_ne57/gtr_ne57_1_105.pdf"><em>SKIING TRENDS</em></a>、<a href="https://blog.lartisien.com/2020/02/st-moritz-a-winter-playground/"><em>St Moritz, A Winter Playground</em></a>、<a href="https://www.summitpost.org/a-short-introduction-to-the-history-of-mountain-guiding/915085"><em>A short introduction to the history of mountain guiding</em></a>、<a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/145940239"><em>the evolutionary story of ski lifts</em></a>、the development of ski resorts in the Alpine region and revelations, and From the elite to the masses: the development and revelations of alpine skiing in the Alpine region by Ye Maosheng of the Department of Sports at Tsinghua University and others are all worth a read.</p>

<h1>The data</h1>
<p>For the historical part, we obtain our data mainly from papers. Many European alpine associations keep records of their membership numbers. Some well-known peaks also have records of the number of early summits and nationalities, etc.</p>

<img src="/static/assets/img/blogs_cn/snow_process/5.png" alt="">
<p class="img_sidenote">Mont Blanc summits by nationality between 1786 and 1878</p>

<img src="/static/assets/img/blogs_cn/snow_process/6.png" alt="">
<p class="img_sidenote">Selected data compiled from papers, journals, and so on</p>

<p>Onto the modern section, international macrodata mainly from Laurent Vanat's <a href="https://www.vanat.ch/RM-world-report-2021.pdf"><em>2021 International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism——Overview of the key industry figures for ski resorts</em></a>.</p>

<p>The domestic data are mainly from the "White Paper on China's Ski Industry" jointly published by the Beijing Olympic City Development Promotion Association and the China Ice and Snow Economy Research Center of the National Research Institute of Economics, the "Investigation Report on the Impact of the New Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Epidemic on China's Ice and Snow Industry", the "Annual Report on the Development of China's Ice and Snow Industry 2019-2020", the "2021 China Ice and Snow Industry Development Research Report", "Research Report on the Development of the Ice and Snow Industry in 2021", etc.</p>

<p>Moreover, some details in the article are from <a href="https://m.mp.oeeee.com/a/BAAFRD000020211229638786.html">"20 years of snow-making in China: from carrying snow in the woods to cover the track, to self-developed snow-making system"</a>. Some of the content comes from the interview materials obtained after we contacted Rongchuang.</p>


<h1>The map</h1>

<p>The snow depth map data in the paper is from <a href="https://data.tpdc.ac.cn/zh-hans/data/df40346a-0202-4ed2-bb07-b65dfcda9368/">Long-term series of daily snow depth dataset in China (1979-2021)</a>.</p>

<p class="img_sidenote">The SVG map Xiaoyin's first exported</p>

<p>The ski resort data on the map was provided by Qunar. However, where to go only provides information such as name and location, not the first opening time. The opening hours were obtained manually by a few of us.</p>

<h1>The drawings</h1>
<p>The drawings for this project were done by my colleague Bichi Dong. I sent him a package of images of St. Moritz, and then talked with him about the images that needed to be drawn and the different elements that would be superimposed on the original images (lights, trams, cable cars, snow machines) as the page scrolled.</p>

<p>He drew them very quickly and they fit perfectly with the overall page design. During the process, though, I didn't express it properly, so he thought he was only working with two drawings, which made him go through more effort to split the layers.</p>

<h1>The development</h1>
<p>It was my first time to tell a story in a scrolly-telling way for this project. When I saw that the page could slide the way I envisioned it, I was really excited!</p>

<p>But this time the scrolly only involved the switching of images and not the interactive changes of the D3 code itself, hopefully in the next project I can do the switching of data (hopefully without puzzling bugs).</p>

<p>Other than the scrolly part, there are not many other interactive elements in this project. It is not too difficult to develop.</p>

<p>Instead, it is worth to pay attention to the different reading experience of computer and cell phone, adjusting and switching the size and position of pictures, the size of words, etc.</p>

<p>It is better to preset the layout of the module on the mobile side when developing, if you consider the mobile side after all the web side is done, it will be a little late.</p>

<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
<p>Overall, I am still very satisfied with the project. The content was well-informed, while the data and illustrations enriched the reader's reading experience. The feedback from the readers was also good.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there were some stumbles in the process due to my lack of experience and weak code base.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Projects with many pictures need to add progress bars</li>
  <p>Before going live, I encountered a very torturous bug that scrolly needed to get its height on the page at this time, then it can change the status of position from "relative" into "absolute".</p>
  <p>Normally, this height is fixed. But because of the image loading, if the reader slides down to the place where the scrolly is needed before the front image is loaded, the page will be wrong.</p>
  <img src="/static/assets/img/blogs_cn/snow_process/11.png" alt="">
  <p>Initially I didn't know it was caused by the image not loading out, and thought it was the scrollTop not taking the correct value. At that time, I went home for the New Year holiday and there was no one to call. After numerous attempts, I finally found out that it was because the previous images were not loaded and the height was 0, so they affected the scrollTop value.</p>
  <p>After adding a preload progress bar and manually setting the image height as a double insurance, I solved this darned and simple bug.(Really speechless at myself when I found the image height to be 0 ......)</p>
  <li>Overflow is not cropped</li>
  <p>The second problem is that in the cell phone, the width of the image is often much larger than the width of the phone screen, so if the user slides the screen to the left, it will slide the frame. At this point, I need to set: overflow-x: hidden;</p>
  <img src="/static/assets/img/blogs_cn/snow_process/12.png" alt="">
  <p>Note: The overflow-x property specifies whether the left/right edges of the content are cropped - if overflowing the content area of the element.</p>
  <li>Translation errors</li>
  <p>Sometimes it's hard to avoid errors in details. For example, the Ostreicher Alpine Association ... but those who know will find it more funny 😂 I need to pay more attention to whether the translation is correct before releasing in the future.</p>
  <img src="/static/assets/img/blogs_cn/snow_process/13.png" alt="">
  <li>Paywalls</li>
  <p>The previous interaction project I worked on was free without the need for a paywall. This time it was a paid project. Therefore, I needed to add a few more pieces of "Paywalls" code.</p>
  <p>After I copied it from the past code, the change didn't go well. Since it was the New Year, I had to fumble around and change it slowly. While changing it, I spat at myself for always procrastinating and making simple things complicated.</p>
  <li>Image copyright</li>
  <p>Because of the paywall, this project is commercial. Thus, it is particularly important that the images are commercially licensed (I don't want to be sued QAQ).</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, there are some interesting pictures that can't be put in the article due to copyright reasons, which is still a bit pity.</p>
</ul>
